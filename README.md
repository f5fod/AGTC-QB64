# AGTC-QB64
## Antenna G/T Calculator written in QB64

### Origin
Look at <https://www.dg7ybn.de/Ant_soft/Antenna_GT_f5fod.htm> for further explanations and to get access to the corresponding .bas and .exe files.
Here, you can get directly the **last versions** of the source and executable files.

Note that the source file is very documented and has been translated in html/JavaScript in 2026: <https://github.com/f5fod/AGTC-JS>.
If you need to recompile the file source, prefer QB64 **32 bits** as QB64 64 bits will give you smaller characters in the Console.

### How to use this *AGTC-QB64* program?
`src/` : QB64 source code `AGTC_anyGTa_2lite_V2-00.bas`<br>
`bin/` : Compiled with QB64 32 bits, Windows executable `AGTC_anyGTa_2lite_V2-00.exe`

Download this executable.
Create an FFTab (Far Field Table) file with EZNEC or 4nec2.
Run the executable.

You will obtain the G/T ratio of your antenna.
